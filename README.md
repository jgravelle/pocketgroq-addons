# PocketGroq Add-ons

A collection of advanced add-ons for PocketGroq, implementing cutting-edge AI research papers to enhance PocketGroq's capabilities. Each add-on is designed to provide specific functionality while maintaining seamless integration with the core PocketGroq framework.

## Components

### 1. FEPS (Free Energy Projective Simulation)
An enhancement that implements interpretable decision-making capabilities using Free Energy Projective Simulation. Based on research from [arXiv:2411.14991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14991).

Key features:
- Clone-based memory structure for handling ambiguous situations
- Enhanced decision making with uncertainty estimation
- Prediction-based learning and adaptation
- Seamless integration with existing PocketGroq features

[Learn more about FEPS](./FEPS/README.md)

### 2. LongKey (Keyphrase Extraction)
A powerful keyphrase extraction add-on designed specifically for analyzing long documents with advanced contextual understanding. Implements methodology from [arXiv:2411.17863](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17863).

Key features:
- Process documents up to 96K tokens
- Advanced embedding strategy using CNNs and max pooling
- Context-aware processing through Longformer architecture
- Flexible integration with PocketGroq

### 3. Literature Review Generator
Extends PocketGroq with automated literature review generation capabilities, based on research from [arXiv:2411.18583](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18583).

Key features:
- PDF processing and metadata extraction
- Multi-document analysis
- Quality evaluation
- Academic writing standards preservation
- RAG integration

### 4. ProActive Agent
Enhances PocketGroq's AutonomousAgent with proactive capabilities based on research from [arXiv:2410.12361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12361).

Key features:
- Environmental awareness and context tracking
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for need detection
- Reward model-based evaluation
- Feedback-driven learning

## Installation

First, install PocketGroq:

```bash
pip install pocketgroq
```

Then clone this repository to get the add-ons:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgravelle/pocketgroq-addons.git
cd pocketgroq-addons
```

Each add-on can be installed manually from its respective directory:

```bash
# Install FEPS
cd FEPS
pip install -e .

# Install LongKey
cd ../keyphrase-extraction
pip install -e .

# Install Literature Review Generator
cd ../literature-review
pip install -e .

# Install ProActive Agent
cd ../proactive-autonomous-agent
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example combining multiple add-ons:

```python
from pocketgroq import GroqProvider
from pocketgroq_feps import enhance_groq_provider
from pocketgroq_longkey import add_longkey_to_groq
from literature_review import LiteratureReviewGenerator
from proactive_agent import ProactiveAutonomousAgent

# Initialize PocketGroq
groq = GroqProvider(api_key="your-api-key")

# Add desired enhancements
enhanced_groq = enhance_groq_provider(groq)
add_longkey_to_groq(enhanced_groq)

# Create specialized components
lit_review = LiteratureReviewGenerator(enhanced_groq)
proactive_agent = ProactiveAutonomousAgent(enhanced_groq)

# Use enhanced capabilities
keyphrases = enhanced_groq.extract_keyphrases(text)
review = lit_review.generate_review(pdf_paths)
async for result in proactive_agent.process_request_proactively(query):
    print(result)
```

## Requirements
